The data on this page was collected in September 2017.\n\nThe CEV can generate reliable estimates at the national level, within states and the District of Columbia, and in the largest twelve Metropolitan Statistical Areas to support evidence-based decision making and efforts to understand how people make a difference in communities across the country.\n\nThis page was updated on January 16, 2025 to ensure consistency across all waves of CEV data.\n\nClick on \"Export\" to download and review an excerpt from the 2017 CEV Analytic Codebook that shows the variables available in the analytic CEV datasets produced by AmeriCorps.\n\nClick on \"Show More\" to download and review the following 2017 CEV data and resources provided as attachments:\n\n1) CEV FAQs – answers to frequently asked technical questions about the CEV\n2) Constructs and measures in the CEV\n3) 2017 CEV Analytic Data and Setup Files – analytic dataset in Stata (.dta), R (.rdata), SPSS (.sav), and Excel (.csv) formats, codebook for analytic dataset, and Stata code (.do) to convert raw dataset to analytic formatting produced by AmeriCorps. \n4) 2017 CEV Technical Documentation – codebook for raw dataset and full supplement documentation produced by U.S. Census Bureau\n5) 2017 CEV Raw Data and Read In Files – raw dataset in Stata (.dta) format, Stata code (.do) and dictionary file (.dct) to read ASCII dataset (.dat) into Stata using layout files (.lis)",
