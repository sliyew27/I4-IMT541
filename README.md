# Weather Comparison: Addis Ababa vs Seattle (April 17–27, 2025)

## Overview

This project presents a comparison of maximum and minimum daily temperatures between Addis Ababa, Ethiopia and Seattle, Washington for the period April 17 to April 27, 2025. The analysis is based on structured weather data compiled in CSV format and visualized through Python. The primary objective is to provide a clear graphical representation of temperature variations between the two cities over the selected timeframe.

## Files in This Project

- `Addis and Seattle Weather 4_17_25-4_27_25.xlsx`: Excel workbook containing daily weather data for Addis Ababa and Seattle. It includes three sheets:
  - `Addis`: Temperature data for Addis Ababa
  - `Seattle`: Temperature data for Seattle
  - `Combined`: A merged dataset used for comparison and visualization
    
- `addis_weather_apr_17_27.csv`  
  CSV file containing raw weather data for Addis Ababa including temperature and precipitation.

- `seattle_weather_apr_17_27.csv`  
  CSV file containing raw weather data for Seattle including temperature and precipitation.

- `addis_seattle_combined_4_17_to_4_27.csv`  
  Combined dataset in CSV format with merged weather data from both cities, used for visual comparison.
  
- `weather_comparison_colab.ipynb`: Python code that runs to show the graphs
- `README.md`: This documentation file providing an overview of the project, file contents, and instructions for viewing the code and results.
